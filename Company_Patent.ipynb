       "'Aerotronic is a data analytics company that uses aerial and ground data to report on the health of power lines at a significant cost reduction versus existing solutions. Powerline inspections today are qualitative, done manually, and stored as hard copies. Engineers fly in a manned helicopter and take notes on the condition of the lines. Each inspection costs $2K+ per mile and takes time to collate and track. High-speed data capture using manned, unmanned, and ground-based vehicles. The data is processed using a proprietary analytics platform and accessed by clients through a web portal. Late stage discussions with 2 utility companies on pilot studies. Flew power lines in North Carolina after Hurricane Florence, and sent findings to FEMA, Duke Energy, & NCDOT. Aerotronic charges for transmission line inspections at $1000/mile (50% market rates with 80% margin). Subscription model to their portal allows for 3D time-series data access and preventative maintenance predictions using machine learning. Marketplace for vegetation management bids and other services allow us to capture commissions which create an additional revenue stream. Chris, the CEO, is a helicopter pilot, aerospace engineer, and on his second drone company after a successful exit. Neerav, the COO, has an MBA, and ran a manufacturing firm with 50 employees specializing in electro-mechanical assemblies for the DoD and its prime contractors. They have developed a hybrid single rotor autonomous unmanned system capable of flying 500 miles; they can cover entire the US with 14 base stations and 28 aircraft can Inspect the entire transmission grid in 5 days.'"
